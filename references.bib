  abstract  = "Scientific research has evolved from an activity mainly
               undertaken by individuals operating in a few locations to many
               teams, large communities, and complex organizations involving
               hundreds to thousands of individuals worldwide. In the 17th
               century, scientists would communicate through letters and were
               able to understand and assimilate major developments across all
               the emerging major disciplines. In 2016---the most recent year
               for which data are available---more than 2,295,000 scientific
               and engineering research articles were published worldwide
               (National Science Foundation, 2018e). In addition, the number of
               scientific and engineering fields and subfields of research is
               large and has greatly expanded in recent years, especially in
               fields that intersect disciplines (e.g., biophysics); more than
               230 distinct fields and subfields can now be identified. The
               published literature is so voluminous and specialized that some
               researchers look to information retrieval, machine learning, and
               artificial intelligence techniques to track and apprehend the
               important work in their own fields.",

@ARTICLE{Wickham2014-yo,
  title    = "Tidy Data",
  author   = "Wickham, Hadley",
  abstract = "A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready
              for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make
              data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper
              tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data
              tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and
              visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a
              column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational
              unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy
              datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal
              with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes
              it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that
              both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a
              consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated
              with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.",

              reproducibility'' are nonstandard and unsettled across the

              implicit definitions of reproducibility and related terminology,
              and discuss how to avoid potential misunderstandings when these
              terms are used as a surrogate for ``truth.''",

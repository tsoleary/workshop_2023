# Welcome {.unnumbered}

Thank you for checking out this workshop! This page contains a brief overview of the goals, structure, and prerequisites. Although, much of the text is written like a book, this is meant to be an active workshop with RStudio open and fingers at our keyboards. We will reference the narrative text occasionally, but mostly its purpose is a solid reference after the fact to fully flesh out the practical principles we will be talking about.

## Goals {.unnumbered}

As an open-source programming language, there is an abundance of approaches to doing data science in R. It is a wide open landscape ready for your exploration! But --- to extend this metaphor to its breaking point --- it isn't just a flat landscape, where each spot is as fertile as the next. It is more complicated. Its closer to a [fitness landscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_landscape) where there are hidden local and global optima ^[![](fitness_landscape.png)]. You are encouraged to explore that space for yourself -- find the high points and low points -- what works best for you and what doesn't^[I am not claiming to have found the global optimum of data science. I promise I would share the secret if I had it.]. But it is my hope that this workshop will serve as a useful initialization of your search of that complex adaptive landscape. And that along the way you will gain tools which will help you dig out of those valleys and climb to the top of those peaks. I have the following high-level goals for this workshop:

1. **Foster an appreciation of the tidyverse and its underlying principles.** Tools in R, and many other programming languages, are constantly evolving and that can make learning new tools seem futile. Especially if you already have something functional with a different set of tools. But the tidyverse, is likely [to stick around](https://lrdegeest.github.io/blog/totalverse), and it also represents something beyond a set of tools. Working with the tidyverse encourages [good coding practices](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/articles/manifesto.html){target="_blank"} that can help us write more useful and readable code. 
1. **Persuade you to go beyond a graph that merely _gets the job done_ and toward a version that most clearly communicates the story behind your data.** There are many ways to represent data in graphical form. Each time we create a figure we are making dozens -- or maybe hundreds -- of choices. Some choices are passive^[like keeping the default theme -- yikes!], and some are active^[Should I use a box plot, strip chart, or violin plot?], and some may have little effect^[I confess I have spent way to much time trying to find the most pleasing shade of purple.], but I hope to convince you that spending some additional time iterating figures that you will share is well worth it.
1. **Encourage best practices to ensure computational reproducibility.** Reproducibility is not just necessary for good science -- it will save you and your collaborators a lot of time in the long run. Making sure your code is reproducible is not as difficult as it may seem. 

## Structure {.unnumbered}

There are three parts to this workshop. But each is designed to be self-contained -- so you may pick-and-choose to attend any or all of these workshops. The three parts are as follows:

1. Computational reproducibility
2. Principles of the tidyverse and advanced techniques
3. Data visualization for presentations and publications

## Prerequisites

This workshop assumes several things^[These prerequisites are intentionally designed to be a relatively low bar. See the green box if you don't meet these prerequisites.]:

1. You have R and RStudio installed on your machine and you come ready to follow along with some coding.
2. You have some basic familiarity with coding in R. For example, you know the difference between a vector and a data frame. 
3. You are able to do some simple tasks in R -- like creating an object, getting the mean of a vector, or importing a csv file.

## Good news if you are starting from zero

**You can meet the above criteria in less than a day!**

There are several great resources on the internet that will walk you through downloading R and R Studio and give you the basics. You will not need much experience at all for our workshop -- just a familiarity with the basics. Due to our limited time, and the wealth of resources covering step zero, we will start at step one and hit the ground running.

##### Resources if you are starting out -- or need a quick refresh
1. [R for Graduate Students](https://bookdown.org/yih_huynh/Guide-to-R-Book/){target="_blank"} -- very accessible introduction to R & the tidyverse
2. [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/){target="_blank"} -- a wonderfully thorough and useful book that emphasizes the tidyverse

## Disclaimer {.unnumbered}

The following workshop contains my opinions on learning R and programming in general. I am no expert -- so please feel free to disagree with me on anything. In general, this workshop is designed to give you some exposure to a few useful topics, but it is by necessity incomplete. Very little, if any, of this workshop is uniquely mine. Instead, over the years, I have compiled a bunch of useful nuggets from other places. And I have packaged those nuggets here to fit within the scope this workshop. But, I strongly encourage you to check out those alternative^[read: better] resources. They are linked below and throughout this document. Therefore, I hope this tutorial will be useful, if through nothing else, as a portal to more useful parts of the internet.

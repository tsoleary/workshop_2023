    "text": "Goals\nAs an open-source programming language, there is an abundance of approaches to doing data science in R. It is a wide open landscape ready for your exploration! But — to extend this metaphor to its breaking point — it isn’t just a flat landscape, where each spot is as fertile as the next. It is more complicated. Its closer to a fitness landscape where there are hidden local and global optima 1. You are encouraged to explore that space for yourself – find the high points and low points – what works best for you and what doesn’t2. But it is my hope that this workshop will serve as a useful initialization of your search of that complex adaptive landscape. And that along the way you will gain tools which will help you dig out of those valleys and climb to the top of those peaks. I have the following high-level goals for this workshop:\n\nEncourage best practices to ensure computational reproducibility. Reproducibility is not just necessary for good science – it will save you and your collaborators a lot of time in the long run. Making sure your code is reproducible is not as difficult as it may seem.\nFoster an appreciation of the tidyverse and its underlying principles. Tools in R, and many other programming languages, are constantly evolving and that can make learning new tools seem futile. Especially if you already have something functional with a different set of tools. But the tidyverse, is likely to stick around, and it also represents something beyond a set of tools. It worth thinking about as a philosophy of programming that can help us write more useful and readable code.\nPersuade you to go beyond a graph that merely gets the job done and toward a version that most clearly communicates the story behind your data. There are many ways to represent data in graphical form. Each time we create a figure we are making dozens – or maybe hundreds – of choices. Some choices are passive3, and some are active4, and some may have little effect5, but I hope to convince you that spending some additional time iterating figures that you will share is well worth it."

The three parts are as follows:\n\nComputational reproducibility\nPrinciples of the tidyverse and advanced techniques\nData visualization for presentations and publications"

    "section": "Prerequisites",
    "text": "Prerequisites\nThis workshop assumes several things6:\n\nYou have R and RStudio installed on your machine and you come ready to follow along with some coding.\nYou have some basic familiarity with coding in R. For example, you know the difference between a vector and a data frame.\nYou are able to do some simple tasks in R – like creating an object, getting the mean of a vector, or importing a csv file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood news if you are starting from zero\n\n\n\nYou can meet the above criteria in less than a day!\nThere are several great resources on the internet that will walk you through downloading R and R Studio and give you the basics. You will not need much experience at all for our workshop – just a familiarity with the basics. Due to our limited time, and the wealth of resources covering step zero, we will start at step one and hit the ground running.\n\nResources if you are starting out – or need a quick refresh\n\nR for Graduate Students – very accessible introduction to R & the tidyverse\nR for Data Science – a wonderfully thorough and useful book that emphasizes the tidyverse"

    "text": "Disclaimer\nThe following workshop contains my opinions on learning R and programming in general. I am no expert – so please feel free to disagree with me on anything. In general, this workshop is designed to give you some exposure to a few useful topics, but it is by necessity incomplete. Very little, if any, of this workshop is uniquely mine. Instead, over the years, I have compiled a bunch of useful nuggets from other places. And I have packaged those nuggets here to fit within the scope this workshop. But, I strongly encourage you to check out those alternative7 resources. They are linked below and throughout this document. Therefore, I hope this tutorial will be useful, if through nothing else, as a portal to more useful parts of the internet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative resources\n\n\n\n\nR for Data Science – a wonderfully thorough and useful book that emphasizes the tidyverse\nR for Graduate Students – very accessible introduction to R & the tidyverse\nFundamentals of Data Visualization – “A guide to making visualizations that accurately reflect the data, tell a story, and look professional.” by Claus O.

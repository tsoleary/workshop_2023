# Methods

I built this template repository while consulting several useful resources. I used a [blog post](https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/2018/08/09/structuring-r-projects/) by Chris Von Csefalvay called _Structuring R Projects_ as a starting point. I added the idea of using [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to show all the code in each of the scripts. This has the ability to print the scripts without actually sourcing the code, which is helpful for scripts that take a substantial computing power and have already been run. Creating a series of small scripts emphasizes the importance of having bite sized chunks of code that do a single task (_e.g._, load data or create a plot).
